Q2)
(i) The inter-quartile range is approximately 5. This value implies that the middle 50% of the data points lie within this range. (ii) The dataset is slightly skewed to the right as the upper whisker is longer than the lower whisker, and there’s an outlier on the right. (iii) If the data point with value 25 changes to 2.5, it would fall within the lower whisker’s range and wouldn’t be considered an outlier anymore


Q3)
(i) The mode of this dataset would lie in the range of 5-10 as that is where the highest frequency occurs. (ii) The dataset is positively skewed, meaning that there are more data points on the left side of the distribution and it tails off to the right. (iii) The box-plot and histogram complement each other in providing information about the dataset. The box-plot provides information about the spread of the data, including the median, quartiles, and outliers. The histogram provides information about the shape of the distribution, including the mode and skewness. Together, these graphs provide a more complete picture of the dataset.


Q2)
 Right-Skewed median is towards the left side it is not normal distribution

 In that case there would be no Outliers on the given dataset because of the outlier the data had positive skewness it will reduce and the data will normal distributed

q3)
The mode of this data set lie in between 5 to 10 and approximately between 4 to 8 
Right-Skewed. Mean>Median>Mode
They both are right-skewed and both have outliers the median can be easily visualized in box plot where as in histogram mode is more visible.

Q4)
 IF 1 in 200 long-distance telephone calls are getting misdirected.
probability of call misdirecting = 1/200 Probability of call not Misdirecting = 1-1/200 = 199/200 The probability for at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number Number of Calls = 5 n = 5 p = 1/200 q = 199/200 P(x) = at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number P(x) = ⁿCₓ pˣ qⁿ⁻ˣ P(x) = (nCx) (p^x) (q^n-x) # nCr = n! / r! * (n - r)! P(1) = (5C1) (1/200)^1 (199/200)^5-1 P(1) = 0.0245037


Q5)
The most likely monetary outcome of the business venture is 2000$ As for 2000$ the probability is 0.3 which is maximum as compared to others

Yes, the probability that the venture will make more than 0 or a profit p(x>0)+p(x>1000)+p(x>2000)+p(x=3000) = 0.2+0.2+0.3+0.1 = 0.8 this states that there is a good 80% chances for this venture to be making a profit

The long-term average is Expected value = Sum (X * P(X)) = 800$ which means on an average the returns will be + 800$

The good measure of the risk involved in a venture of this kind depends on the Variability in the distribution. Higher Variance means more chances of risk Var (X) = E(X^2) –(E(X))^2 = 2800000 – 800^2 = 2160000
