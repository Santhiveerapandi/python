Explorary Data analysis(EDA)

STEP1: Data Cleaning: 
EDA involves examining the information for errors, lacking values, and inconsistencies. 
It includes techniques including records imputation, managing missing statistics, and figuring out and getting rid of outliers.

----> Data loading
-----> Dealing with data type
------> Dealing with missing value
-------> Dealing with outliers


STEP2: Descriptive Statistics:
EDA utilizes precise records to recognize the important tendency, variability, and distribution of variables. 
Measures like suggest, median, mode, preferred deviation, range, and percentiles are usually used.

----> Discriptive measures like mean, median, mode.
-----> varibility like Varience/ standard deviation
------> Skewness and kurtosis


Step3:  Data Visualization: 
EDA employs visual techniques to represent the statistics graphically.
 Visualizations consisting of histograms, box plots, scatter plots, line plots, heatmaps, and bar charts assist in identifying styles, trends, and relationships within the facts.

------> histogram
--------> box plots
------------scatter plots

Step4: Correlation and Relationships: 
EDA allows discover relationships and dependencies between variables.
 Techniques such as correlation analysis, scatter plots, and pass-tabulations offer insights into the power and direction of relationships between variables.

--------> finding correlation analysis
----------> scatter plot and heatmaps to understand the relation.
